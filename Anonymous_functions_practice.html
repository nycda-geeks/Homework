<!-- art 1
- Create a function "findSum" that takes in two parameters and returns the sum of those parameters.
- Create a function "findProduct" that takes in two parameters and returns the product of those parameters.

Part 2
- Create a function "threeOperation" that takes in two parameters, named "x" and "operation". The first parameter is a number. The second parameter is a function.
- "threeOperation" should call the "operation" parameter as a function. It should pass the number 3 along with the "x" parameter to that function.

Part 3
- Call "threeOperation" with the values of "4" and "findSum". Check that your answer is "7".
- Call "threeOperation" with the values of "5" and "findSum". Check that your answer is "8".
- Call "threeOperation" with the values of "4" and "findProduct". Check that your answer is "12".
- Call "threeOperation" with the values of "5" and "findProduct". Check that your answer is "15". -->
