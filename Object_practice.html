// Part 1
// Give it a “title" property with a value that is the title of your book.
// Give it a “body” property which has an array of strings as the value. There should be at least three strings within the array. This array represents the pages of text within your book.

// Part 2
// Create another object with the same format, but different title and different body.

// Part 3
// Now, create a function that “reads” the book by first printing out the title, then printing out each element (page) in the body. For a book with title "Infinite Jest" and pages "Written by David Foster Wallace", "Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children.", and "As a child, he was very precocious.", the output should read as follows:

// Title: Infinite Jest
// Page 1: Written by David Foster Wallace
// Page 2: Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children.
// Page 3: As a child, he was very precocious.

function readBook(book) {
 console.log("Title: " + book.title)
 for (var i = 0; i < book.body.length; i++) {
   var pageNumber = i + 1;
   console.log("Page " + pageNumber + ": " + book.body[i])
 }
}

var book1 = {
 title: "Alice in Wonderland",
